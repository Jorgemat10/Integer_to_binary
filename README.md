## Binary Converter Script
This project is a simple Python script that converts a non-negative integer into its 8-bit binary equivalent. It features a user-friendly loop that allows continuous input until the user decides to exit by entering 'q'.

## About the Project
This script was one of my first projects where I implemented a function and incorporated user input handling, loops, and basic error checking. The main goal was to create a small utility that could handle conversions to binary while also reinforcing fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user interaction.

## Features:
Converts any non-negative integer to an 8-bit binary string.
Handles invalid inputs and guides the user to input valid data.
Allows the user to exit the program gracefully by typing 'q'.
Provides a basic introduction to working with functions and loops in Python.
This project served as a foundational exercise in my Python journey.
